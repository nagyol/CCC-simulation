[CONFIGURATIONMODEL]
; the exponent of the power law distribution of the tree-based degree sequence
; in the directed case, this is the in-degree exponent
gamma = 3.0
; exponent of the out-degree distribution (only for directed-CM models)
out_gamma = 3.0


[SIMULATION]
; AVAILABLE CENTRALITIES
; Standard:
;   betweenness, closeness, harmonic, pagerank, degree, indegree, outdegree, load, katz, eigenvector
; Parameterized:
;   pagerank-XX    : PageRank with damping factor 0.XX (e.g., pagerank-85)
;   betweenness-Y  : Betweenness with cutoff Y (e.g., betweenness-3)
;   closeness-Y    : Closeness with cutoff Y (e.g., closeness-3)
;   load-Y         : Load with cutoff Y (e.g., load-3)
; Sweeps:
;   pagerankDF     : Sweep PageRank damping factors from 0 to 100 with step DFstep
;   betweenness1-Q : Sweep Betweenness cutoffs from 1 to Q
;   closeness1-Q   : Sweep Closeness cutoffs from 1 to Q
;
; note that some centralities make sense only for directed graphs
; program will work with all possible pairs of provided centralities
;
; Example configurations:
; centralities = pagerankDF
; centralities = pagerank, indegree, outdegree, closeness, harmonic
; centralities = betweenness-1, betweenness-2, betweenness-3
; centralities = betweenness1-Q, closeness1-Q
centralities = betweenness, closeness, pagerank

; Global cutoff for compatible centralities (betweenness, closeness, load)
; If set, "betweenness" becomes "betweenness-cutoff", etc.
; Explicit parameters (e.g. "betweenness-5") take precedence.
; cutoff = 3

; Step size for PageRank damping factor sweep (pagerankDF)
DFstep = 10

; Upper bound for cutoff sweeps (betweenness1-Q and closeness1-Q)
Q = 5

; Number of runs of a particular simulation.
; For deterministic graphs, the only reasonable value is 1
runs = 2

; any suffix one might wish to add to output filenames, before '.pdf'
suffix = test-run

; Caching and file management
; cache: Use cached graph topology and centralities if available (default: False)
cache = True
; save: Save generated graph topology to cache (default: False)
save = False
; load: Load graph topology from cache if available (default: False)
load = False
; cache_dir: Directory to store/load cached files (default: cache)
cache_dir = cache
